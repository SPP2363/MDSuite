Implementing your own Calculator
--------------------------------
Whilst MDSuite offers a large selection of calculators, we understand that it is
quite likely we have missed at least one.
For this reason, we wrote the calculator class and the actual calculators in a modular,
transferable way such that you can easily implement your own while getting the most out
of the memory safety and data-set capabilities that make MDSuite a high performance
engine.

In this documentation series we will walk through the main stages of a calculator
and highlight differences you may face using real examples.

In MDSuite there are two types of calculators.
Trajectory calculators, which take data directly from the HDF5 database and compute a
property on the trajectory and the, for lack of a better name, post-analysis
calculators, which take data generated by a trajectory calculator and compute something
on that data. Trajectory calculators include things like radial distribution functions
or diffusion coefficients whereas coordination numbers or potential of mean-force are
post-analysis calculators.

Due to their differences in implementation they warrant separate guidelines.
